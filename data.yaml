projects:
  - name: Boi-lang

      Boi-lang is an esoteric interpreter written in Golang.
      The parsing was written by hand rather than using a parser generator.

    tools: ['golang']
  - name: FinalPHP
    url: github.com/KernelDeimos/FinalPHP
    desc: |
      Years ago I had this strange habit of building
      PHP frameworks. FinalPHP was the result of using what I
      had learned to build an unopinionated microframework that
      could be used in production. It features a concept I
      called `sandwichware`, which is a stack-efficient
      middleware (i.e. based on hooks instead of callbacks).
    tools: ['aura/router', 'symfony/yaml', 'PHP']
  - name: POF-Scraper
    desc: |
      POF-Scraper is a Google Chrome extension which crawls
      profiles on the dating website pof.com, giving each
      profile a score based on a logorithmic keyword counter.

    tools: ['coffeescript', 'chrome']
  - name: 2D Stickfigure Shooter
    desc: |
      Using HTML5 canvas and the Matter.js physics engine
      I built the engine for a multiplayer stickfigure shooter game.
      Unfortunately this is how I learned that CoffeeScript is much
      easier to write than it is to read, so I abandoned this project and put it under the MIT license.

    tools: ['coffeescript', 'node-js', 'html5/canvas', 'matter-js']
  - name: This Resumé
    desc: |
      This resumé was built using web technologies. I also used a
      program I wrote in Golang to automatically compile .sass files
      and generate my resume from a template and yaml file.

          Referencing stack pointers, callback
          side-effects, buggy mailer scripts, PHP;
          these name just a few
          sources of faults I've been privilaged to
          solve.
      - topic: Good Automation Habits
        text: |
          I often try to automate as much as I can and
          use the DRY principle to guide me. I've also
          learned the hard way that for some tasks
          automation can be a time sink as well.
      - topic: Willing to try New Technologies
        text: |
          The AI computer on board this ship gives me
          a cookie every time I try a new technology.
          You can use this to your advantage.
